# intelligent-temperature-controlled-fan-system-using-Arduino
This project implements an intelligent temperature-controlled fan system using Arduino. The system utilizes a TMP36 temperature sensor to continuously monitor ambient temperature, a servo motor functioning as a variable-speed fan, and an I2C LCD display for real-time data presentation. As temperatures rise above 0°C, the fan speed automatically adjusts, increasing proportionally with temperature to maintain optimal cooling. The servo motor's speed is controlled by mapping temperature readings to appropriate servo signals, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.

The system features an intuitive user interface via the LCD screen, displaying both the current temperature in Celsius and the corresponding fan speed. For temperatures at or below 0°C, the fan automatically shuts off to conserve energy. The project demonstrates practical applications of embedded systems in environmental control, showcasing the integration of sensor data acquisition, motor control, and user feedback. This repository contains the complete Arduino code, circuit diagrams, and documentation, providing a comprehensive resource for hobbyists and developers interested in temperature-responsive automation and embedded system design.
